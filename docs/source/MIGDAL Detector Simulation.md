# MIGDAL Detector Simulation

This guide details the settings in `configuration.yaml` for running `process_primary_tracks.py`, as well as the steps performed in `process_primary_tracks.py`. This script performs the entire simulation of particle tracks in the MIGDAL detector (drift+diffusion, amplification, and digitization for both the ORCA Quest camera and ITO readouts).
